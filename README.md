# NKIBistro Group Project

This report summarizes the progress made on the final project for Operation Systems and Development during Week 1 until Week 4.

**[Week 1 Progress]**
  1. The project scope and objectives already defined\
     The scope of an MLOps application for diabetes prediction, it means that the goal is to manage the life cycle of the machine learning model, so that the solution properly works in production. While, the primary objective of this MLops application is to build a robust and reliable pipeline for developing and deploying a machine learning model for diabetes prediction. Furthermore, the application should be designed to handle increasing data volumes and facilitate future enhancements or modifications to the model.
  2. A project plan with timelines and milestones already created\
     To ensure that our MLOps project runs according to plan, we are using Asana to make the project's gantt chart to track progress and execution (Gantt chart) and key milestones.\

  3. Github repository already created
  4. Begin creating CI tools using GitHub Action

**[Week 2 Progress]**
  1. The machine learning model created
  2. Configure the CML as CI tools into github action 

This project is done as a requirement to complete **Operational System Course** at Information Systems Department Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology
